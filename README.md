# Filler
An Ai player that I created to play a game developed by 42 students <br/>
僕は埋めるよ!!  
_I'll fill you!_  

How to run the program:  
`./filler_vm -p1 user1 -p2 user2 -f mapfile`  
Filler_vm is the Ruby exececutable that provides pieces, user1 and user2 are player executables and mapfile is any of the maps provided in the maps directory.
